# FrejaAI

I stole Freja's `twt:[@Troldkaelling](https://twitter.com/Troldkaelling)` brain to create hit tweets

## How to run?
Open `FrejaAI.py` and change this line:

    openai.api_key =  "XXXXX"
Change the value of `api_key` to your OpenAI API key, this can be done by making a developer account on the [OpenAI website](openai.com). 

Make sure you navigate to the FrejaAI directory in your terminal and run

    Python3 FrejaAI.py
